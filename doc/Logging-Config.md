## Initial Aim
- Use of proper logs system throughout the project.
- Logging is a very simple idea of writing to some storage events, data or anything about what happens during your applicationâ€™s execution.
- Each log message is made of, at the very least: timestamp, level and the message itself.

### Use of logs in Play 
- Play provides an API for logging which is accessed through the `Logger` object and uses `Logback` as the default logging engine.
- The Logger API is based on `SLF4J`, and so Logger is based on the `org.slf4j.Logger` interface.
- All loggers inherit from a root logger. Logger inheritance allows you to configure a set of loggers by configuring a common ancestor.
- Log levels are used to classify the severity of log messages.
- [Log levels](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/ScalaLogging#Log-levels)

### Configuration in this project
- As we are using logback we need to provide a config file for it, which is stored under `/conf/logback.xml`
- Logger is set to level `INFO`, which will log any request of level `INFO` or higher `(INFO, WARN, ERROR)` but will ignore requests of lower severities `(DEBUG, TRACE)`.
- Appender is the class, that will actually write your logs somewhere. Here we are making appender for console logs and for a file appender logs that will save all the generated logs under file `/logs`.
- Part of the appender configuration is encoder. Encoders convert whatever you passed to the logger into OutputStream, which is what actually gets written by the appender.
- The most relevant property of the encoder is a pattern.

## Use of Json encoder
- Decided to use JSON as a console logger encoder to parse logs encoded in JSON during filebeat collections of logs from each container and store in elasticSearch index. It will help to filter and sort out the logs according to logger level and messages or with any fields. Look under `decode_json_fields` in `conf/docker/filebeat.yml` file.

- [JSON Formatted Logging With Play](https://tech.kaufhof.io/tutorials/2015/02/03/json-formatted-logging-with-play.html)
- Have added a sbt dependency of `"net.logstash.logback" % "logstash-logback-encoder" % "6.6" intransitive ()`
- Use this library to add the json encoder for the logback
- **Error**: was conflict of Jackson version so had to label as intransitive
- **Note** that by setting intransitive on a dependency you are still fetching that dependency if it's in the library dependencies of the project. You are only avoiding fetching its transitive/sub dependencies.
- See `/conf/logback.xml` to figure how the json is configured and unnecessary fields are ignored 

## Logs that are created by docker container
- Using docker command
  - List docker running containers: `docker ps`
  - See logs created by each container: `docker logs <container-id>`
- Find the log files 
  - All the logs created by each docker container are stored under:
  - Go to: `/var/lib/docker`
  - Have to be root user: `sudo su`
  - `cd` to containers and each container will have `.log` files
  - `tail <container-id>.log`

## Todo and fix
- ~~Redirect all the logs coming from Docker compose up to the new log files under the same folder.~~ See logs that are created by docker container
- ~~Log file is not generated as configured in the logback config file. There is a folder under the project root, but it won't produce any file while the app is running.~~ It was hidden by Intellij that have to fixed in preferences. 
- ~~Since the project will be running from the docker image, not sure where will the logs file will be saved in the server machine. I think instead of saving in the project root directory, can be saved under: `/var/lib`. Might have to research where is the best place to save the log files.~~ Covered in point 1
- ~~Might have to research for the third party services that provides the logging UI build-in platforms like [finagle](https://twitter.github.io/finagle/).~~ Added using ElasticSearch, Kibana and Filebeat: read the `Docker-logs-ELK-stack.md`
