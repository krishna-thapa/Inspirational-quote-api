## Docker
Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows you to quickly build, test, and deploy applications as portable containers that can run virtually anywhere. A container represents a runtime for a single application and includes everything the software needs to run.

Docker is an integral part of modern software development and DevOps continuous integration and deployment pipelines.

### Install Docker on Ubuntu 20.04
Link [here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04/)

### Install Docker compose on Ubuntu 20.04
Link [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-20-04)

### docker-compose cheatsheet
Link [here](https://devhints.io/docker-compose)

```
docker-compose start
docker-compose stop

docker-compose pause
docker-compose unpause

docker-compose ps
docker-compose up

// To stop the cluster: 
docker-compose down

// To destroy the cluster and the data volumes
// (Be careful as it will delete the volumn):
docker-compose down -v
```

## Install Postgres Server in Docker
- [Docker compose up with Postgres tips](https://hashinteractive.com/blog/docker-compose-up-with-postgres-quick-tips/)
- [Use volumes in Docker](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)

### Connect to the Postgres database running in docker
- First start the docker container with postgres image up and running
`docker-compose up`
- Connect to the postgres through terminal
`psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U  admin postgres`
- Password for admin role is *admin*
- Connect to the right database
`\c inspiration_db`
- See all the tables 
`\dt`


## Install ElasticSearch Server in Docker
Link [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.3/docker.html#docker-prod-cluster-composefile)

Data volumes will persist, so itâ€™s possible to start the cluster again with the same data using `docker-compose up`. To destroy the cluster and the data volumes, just type `docker-compose down -v`.


### Elasticsearch in Docker
The images use centos:7 as the base image.

Run the `docker-compose up` to start the docker and to inspect status of the cluster in Docker:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:9200
curl http://127.0.0.1:9200/_cat/health
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:9200/_cat/indices
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:9200/quotes/_doc/_search | jq
```

## Install Redis Server in Docker
[Configure and Run a Docker Container for Redis and Use it for Python](https://medium.com/better-programming/dockerizing-and-pythonizing-redis-41b1340979de)

[How To Configure Redis + Redis Commander + Docker](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-configurate-redis-redis-commander-docker-616136f2)

- create volume `redis-data`: This is where all redis data will be stored, even if container is restarted, data will be there.
- command: ["redis-server", "--appendonly", "yes"] - Start redis in persistent storage mode
- REDIS_HOSTS=local:redis:6379 - tells redis commander how to connect to redis

### Connect to Redis cli running in docker
- Get the Container id of Redis container running in docker

**TODO: Need to protect redis commander interface with login/password using redis-commander. See above link**

```
docker ps
```

- Connect to the redis-cli
```
docker exec -it <container-id> redis-cli
```

- Basic commands:
```
// Get all the lists
KEYS * 

// Delete the list
DEL cache-random-quote
DEL cache-quoteOfTheDay

// Get all the stored values inside the list
LRANGE cache-random-quote 0 -1
LRANGE cache-quoteOfTheDay 0 -1
```

## Docker file

### Run all the databases using docker container
1. Postgres container with the volume for persistent the data
2. CSV data is copied to the mounted volume that is read by the Postgres container volume and copy the fields to the postgres table while the docker is loaded 
3. Redis container with the volume for persistent the data
4. ElasticSearch container with the volume for persistent the data

### Create a docker container for the main web project
1. Create a Dockerfile for the main Scala Play project that creates a docker image 
2. Image is build and push to the docker hub account
3. Update the docker-compose file with the Scala-play web app image that runs in the correct port and has all the dependencies in other database container
4. To make sure all the docker containers are connected, have to update the host names of each database in the main play project. So instead of using localhost, have to implement the docker service name. In this project, these names are should be updated in the application.conf file under the conf folder.
5. All the unnecessary files and storage data are removed while building an image using `.dockerignore`.
6. All the environment variables used in the docker-compose file can be moved to the Dockerfile
7. COPY method to upload the CSV file data to the Postgres table     

### Docker commands
```
// Create a Docker image from Dockerfile:
docker build -t inspirational-quote-api:latest .

// See docker images with id
docker image la -a

// Create a tag with dockerhub username:
docker tag b6e1d7960e75 krishnathapa/inspirational-quote-api:v0.1

// Push to the dockerhub
docker push krishnathapa/inspirational-quote-api:v0.1

// Remove imgage
docker image rm <iamge ids>

// see all the containers
docker container ls --all

// Stop container and remove
docker stop <container id>
docker rmi 

// Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete b6e1d7960e75 (must be forced) - image is referenced in multiple repositories
// First remove all the tag and then delete the docker image
docker rmi inspirational-quote-api:v0.1
docker rmi b6e1d7960e75

// sh into the docker running container:
docker exec -it c142a1ec9f31 /bin/sh
```

### How to Do a Clean Restart of a Docker Instance
```
// Stop the container(s) using the following command:
docker-compose down

// Delete all containers using the following command:
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)

// Delete all volumes using the following command:
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)

// Restart the containers using the following command:
docker-compose up -d
```

## Known errors while setting up docker:
- [Docker Container exited with code 137](https://www.petefreitag.com/item/848.cfm#:~:text=As%20it%20turns%20out%20this,in%20and%20terminated%20the%20process.)
- Problem faced while working [sbt-native-packager](https://sbt-native-packager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): While running the `sbt docker:publishLocal`, there was an error regarding swagger package. I believe this error is related with swagger library, and I don't think there is a solution unless the library is removed from the project. [Error issue page](https://github.com/iheartradio/play-swagger/issues/190).
