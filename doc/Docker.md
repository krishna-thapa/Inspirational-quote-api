## Docker
Docker is an open-source containerization platform that allows you to quickly build, test, and deploy applications as portable containers that can run virtually anywhere. A container represents a runtime for a single application and includes everything the software needs to run.

Docker is an integral part of modern software development and DevOps continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
