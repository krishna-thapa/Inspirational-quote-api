- 
- Make genre as enum (http requests not working atm)
- Use scalaftm for scala code formatting (create new config file to define custom formatting rules)
- Set-up Github Action for CI/CD tools: create a yml to run sbt test and compile every time code is merged to master 
- Use scalaftm stb task keys to run formatting check in guthub action </del>
- Make genre enum as list of genre: might not be needed
- Make genre as option to hold empty: for JSON data as it doesn't have genre field
- Docker compose
- fix id issue that should start from 1 when table is dropped
- Play around with JSON: store the data in Postgres as NoSQL 
- Do random read operation using NoSQL JSON data file 
- Introduce feature of making favorite in selected quotes

## Tickets to do un Front-end
- Create a Vue.js project inside the same repo of inspirational-quote using vue ui 

## Major issues faces so far
- Splitted routes are not recompiled: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55289199/the-generated-route-files-of-play-framework-are-re-generated-automatically-even
- Disable the CSRF filter for a specific route in the routes file: add the nocsrf modifier tag before your route (for POST, PUT and DELETE)
- Use of enumeration with slick in play framework
    - Update a column with type enumeration using play-slick: Need to define the custom column type: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47944361/play-slick-updating-enumeration-column
    - Implement an implicit Writes or Format for a case class including an Enumeration: https://github.com/jethrogillgren/play-samples/blob/workingversion/play-scala-hello-world-tutorial/app/models/Search.scala
